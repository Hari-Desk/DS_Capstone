FinSythesis

A Multi-Agent GenAI Framework for Stock Price Forecasting with Sentiment and Market Signals

ðŸ“Œ Overview

FinSythesis is a multi-agent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for financial decision-making.
It simulates the workflow of a trading firm, where specialized AI agents (Fundamentals, Sentiment, News, Technical, Trader, and Risk/Portfolio Manager) collaborate and debate to produce Buy / Hold / Sell recommendations.

The system integrates real-time APIs (Finnhub, yfinance) and cached datasets for reproducibility, while leveraging LangChain, LangGraph, and modern LLMs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) for reasoning.
