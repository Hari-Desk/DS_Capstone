        "1 Introduction\n",
        "The stock market operates within a complex and volatile ecosystem where the buying and selling of\n",
        "stocks often occurs amidst high liquidity and constant price fluctuations [13, 16]. This environment\n",
        "is consistently shaped by the interplay of various participants, including individual investors,\n",
        "institutions, and automated trading systems [36, 48]. The trading behaviors of these participants\n",
        "reflect a complex result of competition and cooperation, influenced by uncertainties such as\n",
        "economic trends [31], geopolitical events [15], and psychological factors (e.g., market sentiment)\n",
        "[45]. Consequently, the rapid pace of trading, coupled with the vast amount of available information,\n",
        "poses significant challenges for traders to make consistently well-informed decisions.\n",
        "This underscores the necessity for data-driven tools like algorithms or simulations to facilitate\n",
        "informed and strategic investment decisions. The prevalent method involves backtesting with\n",
        "historical data to simulate trading environments and assess strategies. Popular tools for this purpose\n",
        "include Zipline [26], Backtrader [18], and PyAlgoTrade [19]. These event-driven models for trading\n",
        "simulation can help evaluate trader-designed strategies. In addition, the integration of machine\n",
        "learning techniques has opened up new avenues for supporting investment decisions [12, 25, 37].\n",
        "Among those, one popular tool is called Trading Gym [32], which leverages reinforcement learning\n",
        "to optimize investment strategies.\n",
        "While historical data-based analysis offers valuable insights, its static nature and retrospective\n",
        "bias can limit its effectiveness in supporting financial decisions in a dynamic and evolving environment [4, 6]. Consequently, simulations or machine learning models trained on historical data\n",
        "may overfit and fail to accurately reflect real-time market liquidity or the influence of collective\n",
        "sentiment. On the other hand, understanding the mechanisms of market operations, particular the\n",
        "interplay between stakeholders and market sentiment, is crucial for developing robust investment\n",
        "strategies [5, 11]. Simulating human sentiments and behaviors can provide a closer approximation\n",
        "of how investment strategies can work in response to the market’s rapidly evolving nature, bridging\n",
        "gaps left by traditional data analysis.\n",
        "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT and Gemini can facilitate simulations of complex stakeholder interactions [17, 23]. Integrating these LLMs into agent-based\n",
        "systems has been demonstrated useful in conducting intricate simulations across various disciplines\n",
        "[23, 53]. One reason is that these LLMs are trained on extensive datasets and have shown immense\n",
        "capability to comprehend, generate, and reason through diverse scenarios. These reasoning abilities empower LLMs to model intricate systems where individual LLM-based agents can interact\n",
        "dynamically and make decisions under evolving conditions [1], which is particularly advantageous\n",
        "for simulating the dynamics of stock markets. In this regard, multiple recent studies have leveraged\n",
        "LLMs to enhance stock market simulations that can mimic complex human behaviors, addressing\n",
        "backtesting limitations. These simulations can also replicate social dynamics by leveraging LLMs’\n",
        "generalization capabilities [10, 17, 23, 28, 38, 41, 52, 57].\n",
        "However, applying these technologies to fully comprehend the nuanced investor behaviors in\n",
        "financial markets still remains a largely under-explored area. Several research questions are worth\n",
        "further exploration. First, it is imperative to explore how various external factors can influence the\n",

        "trading behaviors and performance outcomes of AI Agents. Second, it is still unclear to what extent\n",
        "the inherent tendencies and learning capabilities of LLM-based agents can impact the reliability and\n",
        "effectiveness of stock recommendations and quantitative trading strategies across various scenarios.\n",
        "To address these gaps, our study introduces StockAgent, an innovative LLM-based multi-agent\n",
        "stock trading framework that operates on event-driven simulations. Our study aims to investigate\n",
        "the following three questions:\n",
        "• RQ1. Simulation Effectiveness Are the simulation results (i.e., trading decisions) of StockAgent reliable when using different LLMs to drive the simulation?\n",
        "• RQ2. LLM Reliability Does StockAgent’s stock recommendation and trading strategy be\n",
        "influenced by the inherent tendencies of the selected LLM itself?\n",
        "• RQ3. Simulated Trading under External Conditions Can StockAgent reasonably and\n",
        "autonomously simulate stock trading based on different scenario settings, especially exploring how external factors (e.g., financial data, market indicators, benchmark interest rates,\n",
        "emergencies, and after-hours Bulletin Board System (BBS) discussions) affect its trading\n",
        "behavior?\n",

        "agent interactions. We simulate trading to observe how AI Agents’ decision-making, informed\n",
        "by varied information, influences market indicators like volatility and liquidity. The simulation\n",
        "flow is presented in Figure 2. In the following, we refer to each agent adhering to the StockAgent\n",
        "framework design as an “AI Agent,” since the simulation and backbone LLMs may vary. To clarify,\n",
        "StockAgent is a framework design, while an AI Agent is an independent agent entity that follows\n",
        "the StockAgent framework but is specifically aimed at implementing trading strategies.\n",
        "In addition, our simulation replicates real market conditions to assess agents’ impact on these\n",
        "indicators. In this regard, we design our trading processes based on the trading sessions and\n",
        "mechanisms employed by NASDAQ and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange [22, 35]. To further\n",
        "illustrate the trading process, we select two stocks from the United States stock market, referred to\n",
        "as anonymized Stock A and Stock B. We use their financial reports—specifically, the balance sheet,\n",
        "income statement, and cash flow statement—as the basis for calculating the initial settings of our\n",
        "simulation. Overall, Stock A is a stock that is already circulating in the stock market, while Stock B\n",
        "is a newly issued stock that is currently in the IPO stage.\n",
        "4.1 Initial Assumptions and Settings\n",
        "In StockAgent trading simulations, it is crucial to set clear initial assumptions and initial settings.\n",
        "These underlying parameters ensure that the simulation gives a true representation of market conditions and behavior. A clear initial configuration prevents AI agents from behaving unpredictably\n",
        "or arriving at results that are unreliable or difficult to interpret. By setting clear boundaries and\n",
        "capabilities for AI agents and market environments, we can systematically explore how different\n",
        "conditions can affect trading outcomes. These assumptions and settings include (1) agent initial\n",
        "assumptions, (2) agent initialization settings, and (3) market initialization settings.\n",
        "4.1.1 StockAgent Initial Assumptions.\n",
        "• StockAgent Setup Assuming basic common sense of stock market trading, our StockAgent\n",
        "can make profitable trades to maximize profits. This maximizes profits and consists of\n",
        "maximizing the total value of assets and cash. The StockAgent also has a basic estimation\n",
        "ability.\n",
        "• StockAgent Trading Behavior We restrict the StockAgent actions to buy, sell, hold, long\n",
        "and short. Among them, buying, selling, and holding are defined as basic behaviors, long\n",
        "and short selling are defined as derived behaviors, and StockAgent can use basic behaviors\n",
        "according to the basic knowledge of the stock market.\n",
        "• StockAgent Financial Behavior We assume that under the existing StockAgent framework,\n",
        "the StockAgent can understand the financial attempt settings we set for loans, interest rates,\n",
        "dividends, and bankruptcy and use or avoid the above situations according to the goal of\n",

        "• Personality and Assets Allocation: Each agent is endowed with distinct personality traits,\n",
        "influencing their trading styles. Initial assets are allocated randomly within a range of 100,000\n",
        "to 5,000,000 currency units, which is the sum of an agent’s available cash and the market\n",
        "value of stocks. The random allocation ensures a diverse spectrum of wealth among agents.\n",
        "• Debt Configuration: Agents may incur debt, with the amount not exceeding the value of\n",
        "their capital. The loan-to-value ratio is capped to ensure realistic leverage levels.\n",
        "• Transaction Cost: We set the transaction stamp tax according to the rules of the American\n",
        "stock market. We put the transaction fee of each Agent in purchasing shares to 0.005 currency\n",
        "units per share, the minimum transaction fee of each transaction is 1 currency unit, and the\n",
        "maximum transaction fee is 5.95 currency units.\n",
        "4.1.3 Market Initialization Settings.\n",
        "• Trading Year: The simulation covers one year comprising 264 trading days, divided into\n",
        "four quarters of 66 trading days each.\n",
        "• Interest Rates and Deposits: For companies and individuals, the deposit rate is 0%, reflecting\n",
        "contemporary low-interest-rate environments.\n",
        "• Personal Loan Costs: Agents are subject to varying interest rates on loans, with different\n",
